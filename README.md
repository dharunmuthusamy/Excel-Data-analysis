# Sales Data Analysis & Data Modeling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing sales data** to uncover meaningful business insights and building a **structured data model** for better understanding, reporting, and decision-making.  
The analysis is performed using a real-world sales dataset stored in an Excel file.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Sales performance evaluation  
- Data modeling for structured analysis

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales-related information such as:
- Product details  
- Sales quantity  
- Revenue / sales amount  
- Time-based attributes (date, month, year)  
- Customer or region-related fields (if applicable)

> Note: The dataset is used purely for analysis and learning purposes.

## Objectives
- Understand overall sales performance  
- Identify trends and patterns in sales data  
- Analyze product-wise and time-wise sales behavior  
- Create a logical **data model** that represents relationships between sales entities  
- Provide insights that can support business decisions  

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning (handling missing or inconsistent values)  
- Sales trend analysis  
- Revenue contribution analysis  
- Product/category performance analysis  
- Time-based analysis (monthly / yearly trends)  

---

## Data Modeling
The data modeling aspect includes:
- Identifying key entities (e.g., Sales, Products, Time, Customers)  
- Structuring data into meaningful tables  
- Establishing relationships between entities  
- Designing a model suitable for reporting and future analytics  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and modeling  
- **Spreadsheet functions & formulas**  
- **Pivot tables and charts** (if used)

---

## Key Insights
- Highlights high-performing products and periods  
- Identifies sales growth and decline trends  
- Helps understand revenue distribution  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Perform analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Build interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)  
- Apply predictive modeling for sales forecasting  
- Normalize data into a relational database
